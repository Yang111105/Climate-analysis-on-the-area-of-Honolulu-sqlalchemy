### Climate analysis on the area of Honolulu, Hawaii to help with trip planning.

**1. Provided climate analysis and data exploration of hawaii.sqlite database**

**2. Precipitation Analysis**
- Retrieved the last 12 months of precipitation data and plotted with Pandas
- Design a query to retrieve the last 12 months of temperature observation data for the most active station

**3. Designed a Flask API based on varies queries:**
- Home page
- /api/v1.0/precipitation
- /api/v1.0/stations
- /api/v1.0/tobs
- /api/v1.0/start and /api/v1.0/start/end

**4. Temperature Analysis**
- Performed paired t test to determine whether the difference in the means between temperature from different months is statistically significant
- Called functions to check minimum, average, and maximum temperatures for matching dates from a previous year
- Checked rainfall per weather station 
- Calculate the historical daily normals for the duration of the trip and visualized with area plot
